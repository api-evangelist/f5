### F5
Welcome to the F5 BIG-IQ API page. The BIG-IQ 8.1.0 API is a well-documented REST API that provides a range of capabilities for scripting BIG-IQ workflows. Many BIG-IQ users may choose to script BIG-IQ workflows using public APIs to help make the deployment and management of applications on the BIG-IP system easier. For example, an application manager can use the BIG-IQ Public API in scripts to monitor, troubleshoot, modify, and largely manage their application throughout its lifecycle.
