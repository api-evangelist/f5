      Welcome to the F5® BIG-IQ™ API page. The BIG-IQ 8.1.0 API is a
      well-documented REST API that provides a range of capabilities for
      scripting BIG-IQ workflows. Many BIG-IQ users may choose to script BIG-IQ
      workflows using public APIs to help make the deployment and management of
      applications on the BIG-IP system easier. For example, an application
      manager can use the BIG-IQ Public API in scripts to monitor, troubleshoot,
      modify, and largely manage their application throughout its lifecycle.
